# Python Data Engineer / Analyst Learning – Crypto Focus 🚀

Welcome to my structured Python learning journey for Data Analysis, Data Engineering & Machine Learning.  
This repo tracks my 45-day plan to master Python libraries, build crypto data projects, and become job-ready for remote roles.

## 📅 Learning Roadmap

| Phase | Focus | Key Libraries |
|-------|--------|----------------|
| 1 | Data Handling & Analysis | numpy, pandas |
| 2 | Visualization | matplotlib, seaborn |
| 3 | Data Engineering | SQL, requests, BeautifulSoup, schedule, PySpark |
| 4 | Machine Learning | scikit-learn, xgboost |
| 5 | Deep Learning | tensorflow, keras (LSTM) |
| 6 | Dashboard & Cloud | Plotly, Streamlit, AWS S3, Docker |

## 🧠 Goal
- Build 3 major data projects  
- Create professional GitHub portfolio  
- Apply for **remote Python Data Engineer / Analyst** roles
